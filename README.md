Project name: HYPERCONTEXT
Author : Adrian Nuske

HYPERCONTEXT is a "lab-project" attempting to simplify presentation diagrams, to make it easy to visually navigate for the public.
It includes charts and timelines, arranging the info i a tree-styled fashion, and adding the complexity of n-deeper elements composing charts and timelines, interacting with the general hierarchy.
The interface is intuitive and fun, with thumb-controls to avoid the "pinch-n-drag" precision issues.
The user can enter and exit edition-mode at any time, to make changes on the fly.
